# Punchr
Punchr is a personal planning app I made for my own use.

The intention is for it to be used like a personal assistant-- it can always tell you what you SHOULD be doing at any given time.

It's made for people who have a lot of unstructured time at their disposal, but want to keep up their productivity.  While it can manage firm appointments, places you MUST be at given times and places, it's far more made for freelancers, employees with loose schedules, etc.  

I very highly admire Jordan Peterson's approach to time management, (explained [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVhj_phpAYQ)) but I have trouble with doing what my calendar tells me WHEN I scheduled to do it.  I ended up just ignoring them to the point that they became meaningless.

Rather than treating time management as something you have to do always NOW, this is an attempt to treat it like a budget, and also allow people who very highly value their unstructured time to hold themselves accountable.

Plans to sync with Google Calendar and iOS.
